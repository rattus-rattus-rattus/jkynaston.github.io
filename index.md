#### Technical information
Many of our worksheets are provided in `.pdf` format and are compiled using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). If you know how to use LaTeX and would like to modify any of these resources, we provide `.tex` files alongside all of our compiled `.pdf` documents. Please refer to the [LaTeX help page]({% link pages/latex.md %}) for information on compiling these documents, as they have nonstandard dependencies not found on CTAN.
