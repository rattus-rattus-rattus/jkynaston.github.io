# Core Maths
{% include "under-construction.html" %}

Core Maths is a relatively new qualification that was launched by the UK government in 2020. It was created with the aim of increasing the number of students who take maths beyond the age of 16, and is designed specifically for students not studying AS or A level maths.

Since nearly all university degrees involve maths to some extent, Core Maths is a fantastic choice for you if you are considering studying at university after your A levels. Core Maths is likely to be particularly valuable to anyone studying courses with mathematical or statistical elements such as:

- Psychology,
- Geography,
- Business and/or management,
- Medicine or the medicinal sciences,
- Sports and exercise science;
- and many more...

Even if you aren't planning to study after your A levels, maths is used everywhere in professional and technical fields. Core Maths focusses on developing fluency and confidence in using and applying mathematical and statistics skills to address authentic problems/real-life scenarios, with a strong emphasis on contextualised problem-solving. The Core Maths course will prepare you for the varied contexts in which you will find mathematics, both in vocational and academic study, and in future employment and life.
