<p>Our mission here at the Maths Orchard is simple - to provide high-quality maths resources for free.</p>

<p>Whether youâ€™re a teacher looking for resources to help you plan lessons or a maths student looking for revision material, we hope you can find something useful here. All of the resources produced by us are free for use under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC</a> license. We also provide some useful links to activities and material elsewhere on the internet. Weâ€™ve only just got started producing and uploading content here, so keep your eyes peeled over the coming months for more content.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting the maths orchard - we hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

<h3 id="technical-information">Technical information</h3>
<p>Many of our worksheets are provided in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> format and are compiled using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. If you know how to use LaTeX and would like to modify any of these resources, we provide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> files alongside all of our compiled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> documents. Please refer to the <a href="">LaTeX help page</a> for information on compiling these documents, as they have nonstandard dependencies not found on CTAN.</p>
